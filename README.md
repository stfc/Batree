###

Compile with `make batree`.

Sample runs:
```
mpirun -np 1 ./batree -m SPM
mpirun -np 3 ./batree -m SPMe
mpirun -np 4 ./batree -m P2D
```

Under active development. No explicit time integration methods are supported
at this time. Use `-m` or `--method` to select from the three electrochemical
models (SPM by default). At the moment, the program will only perform a single
CC discharge cycle until the time specified with `-tf` or `--t-final` (3600s by
default). Run with `-h` or `--help` for all available options.

Details on the formulation, including parametrisation, scaling and literature
references can be found under [docs/](docs). Refer to [validation/](validation)
for a simple script comparing the results of our implementation against PyBAMM
for an LG M50 cell.
